# AdventureMaker
Welcome to AdventureMaker - a VERY lightweight text adventure creation tool. Use this web app to generate text adventure JSON data, which can then be read back to play the game. Use the built-in "play" page, or take the JSON data and build your own app to run the game.

I made this site as a personal tool to test my own text adventures, and decided to publish it. It is a very rough draft with minimal UI enhancements.
